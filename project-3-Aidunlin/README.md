## Signing Up for an OpenWeather API account and getting an API key

- Sign up for a free OpenWeather.org account at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
  - You will get prompted with your occupation/role. Please select education.

## JavaScript code to access the API

- The documentation for the API's can be found at https://openweathermap.org/API
- You will be using the 'Current Weather Data' and the '5 day / 3 hour Forecast' API's.
- Current Weather - https://openweathermap.org/current
- 5 Day Forecast - https://openweathermap.org/forecast
- You will find the information on the icons for forecasts that you can use on your web pages here https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
- You can also use your own iconography and graphics if you prefer

## Things you must do

- Review the weather.js code that has been provided. The code for the getCurrentWeather() function is complete and works. However, you must make the forecast appear differently than what has been provided.
- You must comment all of the JavaScript code that you develop.
- You should also use the code to help you develop new code for the getWeatherForecast() function.
- You must develop additional code to show data for the current weather and the forecasted weather to include the following data:
  - Low temperature
  - High temperature
  - Humidity
  - Feels Like
  - Wind Speed
- A second <button> must be added for the 5 day forecast and its listener must call the getWeatherForecast() function. Again, this code will be very similar to the code provided for the current weather.
- You must also add 2 other data points of your choice to both the getCurrentWeather() and getWeatherForecast() functions.
- You must change the CSS to make the page professional looking and visually appealing
- Your page must pass all WAVE tests. This means no alerts, errors or contrast errors.
- Your page must also pass HTML and CSS Validation
