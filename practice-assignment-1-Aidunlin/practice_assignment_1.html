    <main>
        <p>Aidan Linerud here. I'm a programmer and video-gamer, particularly with difficult-but-rewarding languages (Rust) and video games (Dark Souls). Now six months from drinking age (though I will never drink), I've lived in the Camas/Washougal area for half of my life; the other half was south of Spokane. I have an amazing dog and a slightly less amazing brother (his face, probably: ðŸ˜’).</p>

        <h2>Skill, knowledge, and enjoyment</h2>
        <p>I've been programming (mostly HTML/CSS/JS) since middle school. Recently, I've started experimenting with Svelte (with SvelteKit and TypeScript), Rust, and the Godot Engine, and I absolutely enjoy using each of them. Svelte/SvelteKit/TypeScript is a night-and-day difference compared to vanilla; Rust is... well... I wish it was the only language I had to learn; and the Godot Engine just improved its scripting language in its latest (and biggest) release, along with pretty much every other part of the engine. I have projects for each of these tools/languages (some only ideas, the rest are unfinished).</p>
        <p>Here's a list of languages I know and have used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JS</li>
            <li>TypeScript</li>
            <li>Rust</li>
            <li>GDScript (Godot Engine)</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I want to accomplish (in this class)</h2>
        <p>There's this book series called <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">You Don't Know JS</a>, that is more or less an extremely eye-opening response piece to hate and frustration around JavaScript. I've known about it for a while, but I haven't started reading it until a couple days ago. I decided I want to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript, and really learn the underlying features of the language (e.g. scope and closure), alongside what's being taught in this class.</p>
